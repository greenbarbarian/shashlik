Sure, shashlik is a delicious skewered meat dish commonly found in Eastern European and Central Asian cuisines. Here's a basic recipe for beef shashlik:

Ingredients:

- 1.5 lbs (700g) beef (such as sirloin or tenderloin), cut into 1-inch cubes
- 1 large onion, roughly chopped
- 3-4 bell peppers (red, green, yellow), cut into chunks
- Wooden or metal skewers (if using wooden skewers, soak them in water for 30 minutes before using)
- Salt and black pepper to taste

Marinade:

- 1/4 cup olive oil
- 1/4 cup plain yogurt
- 3 cloves garlic, minced
- 2 tablespoons red wine vinegar
- 1 teaspoon paprika
- 1 teaspoon ground cumin
- 1 teaspoon ground coriander
- 1/2 teaspoon cayenne pepper (adjust to your spice preference)
- Salt and black pepper to taste

Instructions:

1. In a bowl, mix all the marinade ingredients together until well combined.
2. Place the beef cubes in a resealable plastic bag or a shallow dish and pour the marinade over the meat, ensuring it's well coated. Marinate in the refrigerator for at least 2-4 hours, or ideally overnight, to allow the flavors to infuse.
3. Preheat the grill to medium-high heat.
4. Thread the marinated beef, onion chunks, and bell pepper onto the skewers, alternating between the ingredients.
5. Season the skewers with salt and black pepper.
6. Grease the grill grates lightly to prevent sticking. Place the skewers on the grill and cook, turning occasionally, until the meat is cooked to your desired doneness and the vegetables are slightly charred, about 10-15 minutes.
7. Remove the shashlik from the grill and let it rest for a few minutes before serving.
8. Serve the beef shashlik hot with your choice of side dishes like rice, flatbread, or salad.

Remember, you can adjust the spices and marinade ingredients to suit your taste preferences. Enjoy your homemade shashlik!
